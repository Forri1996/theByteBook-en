In this chapter, we introduced the Linux kernel network framework NETFILTER and IPTables, Conntrack and other mechanisms. The high -concrete scenes will face the challenges of these mechanisms. This is also the cornerstone of subsequent container networks, load balancing and other applications.In addition, DPDK and XDP also show the direction of the ultimate network optimization. However, the single -machine performance always has limitations regardless of the optimization, and the large -scale application of large -scale applications will eventually go to distributed.Next chapter, let's enter the first part of the distributed system -load balancing.
