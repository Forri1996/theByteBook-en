# Foreword

More than a decade ago, cloud computing was a rather elusive concept, with most people questioning whether the lofty concept of the "cloud" could truly materialize. However, skepticism did not impede the progress of technology. After more than ten years of development, the concept of cloud computing has become familiar, and migrating to the cloud has become the preferred choice for many small and medium-sized enterprises.

The evolution of cloud-native technologies, including containerization, microservices, service mesh, and others, continues to progress. These technologies have become indispensable topics at major internet conferences. For some enterprises, new technologies often start from being "unseen," then progress to being "underestimated," followed by "uncomprehended," and ultimately end up with the struggle of "keeping up" with them.

## Characteristic

- Holistic Approach: This book provides a comprehensive overview of architectural systems, covering topics such as underlay networks, container and cloud-native networking, gateway practices, microservices and distributed systems, cloud-native concepts, quality monitoring, and cost management. It helps engineers swiftly grasp the entirety of architectural systems.

- Integration of Theory and Practice: Starting from principles, the content and technological choices are geared towards practical implementation, aiming to yield tangible benefits for enterprises.

- Concise Language and Strong Readability: The book minimizes code descriptions and complex sentence structures. It emphasizes clear and concise textual explanations, complemented by architectural diagrams and flowcharts, making it highly readable.
